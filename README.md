# Appliance-Energy-Prediction-Model
Predicts household appliance energy consumption using temperature, humidity, weather, and time features. After preprocessing and scaling with RobustScaler, models were trained and evaluated. Random forest gave the best results, making the model suitable for smart home energy optimization.
